# Alternate Timeline News

Headlines from parallel universes. What's happening in the timelines where things went differently.

## What Is This?

Somewhere out there, in a universe adjacent to ours, Apple just acquired Denmark. Scientists discovered cheese is sentient. A capybara was elected Prime Minister.

This is the news from those timelines.
